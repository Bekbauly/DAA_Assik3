# Assignment 3: Optimization of a City Transportation Network (Minimum Spanning Tree)

# Project Overview

This project implements Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to determine the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph. The idea is inspired by a real-world scenario where a city aims to connect all its districts with roads in the most cost-effective way.
